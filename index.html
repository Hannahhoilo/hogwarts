					<h1>About Hogwarts</h1>

					<p>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, often shortened to Hogwarts, is a Scottish wizarding school located in the Scottish Highlands. We accepts any magical student residing in the islands of Great Britain and Ireland at the age of eleven years old at the start of the incoming term for enrolment. We are a state-owned school, funded by the British Ministry of Magic.</p>
					<p>The precise location of the school could never be uncovered because it is rendered Unplottable. To Muggles (non-magical people), the school appeares to be an old, abandoned castle. Similarly, most wizarding schools' locations are protected in order to prevent their ways of teaching being revealed, as well as protect the students and schools themselves from any harm.</p>
					<p>Hogwarts School, located somewhere in the Highlands of Scotland, consists of the large Hogwarts Castle and extensive school grounds surrounding it, which includes sloping lawns, flowerbeds, vegetable patches, as well as a loch (called the Black Lake), a large dense forest (called the Forbidden Forest), several greenhouses and other outbuildings, and a full-size Quidditch Pitch. One of the castle's towers holds an owlery, which houses all the owls owned by the school and by students.</p>
					<img src="assets/pictures/schoolgrounds.jpg" alt="schoolgrounds" class="schoolgrounds">
					<p>Hogwarts was founded around 990 A.D. by four of the greatest wizards and witches of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They each represented an aspect of personality that they wanted to bring out in new students. They also placed certain protective enchantments in place to ensure the well-being of their students, for which reason the castle and grounds have always been protected with Anti-Apparition Charms.</p>
					<img src="assets/pictures/Founders.jpg" alt="founders" class="founders">
					<p>The new term will begin on 1 September, every year. Students usually reaches Hogwarts via the Hogwarts Express, which left Platform 9¾ of London's King's Cross Station at 11 a.m. sharp. be aware that King's Cross Station is a muggle-station, so do your best to blend in. Please wear muggle-clothes for this occasion (you are able to change to your wizarding robes on the train). When you are entering Platform 9¾, do so discreetly, muggles are not used to people wanishing into the walls. It is recomended that all students travel to the station with a guardian.</p>

					<h2>Hogwarts boats and The Sorting Ceremony</h2>
					<p>The Hogwarts boats are traditionally used to transport the first-year students, accompanied by the Keeper of the Keys, across the Black Lake from Hogsmeade station to the castle at the start of the school year. Older students will be transported via carriages.</p>
					<p>Just before the Start-of-Term Feast will begin, new students are Sorted into one of four houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin) by the Sorting Hat. The Hat analysed each student's mind, looking for specific characteristics that it used to decide where to put each student. After the Sorting, the Headmaster will say a few words and the feast would begin.</p>

					<div class="upon-the-first">
					<div>Upon the first year, you will be learning how to cast and use different spells.</div>
					<div>In the sorting ceremony, you will be placed in your house. You will eat, sleep and study with the other members of your house.</div>
					<br>
					<div>"The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honour. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours." — Minerva McGonagall to first-year students on 1 September 1991, shortly before the Sorting Ceremony</div>

						<div class="hufflepuff-accordion">
							<button class="hufflepuff-accordion__toggle">Hufflepuff</button>
							<div class="hufflepuff-accordion__content">Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses, valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members. Students belonging to this house were known to be hard-working, friendly, loyal, honest and rather impartial. It might be that due to their values, Hufflepuffs were not as competitive as the other houses, and were more modest about their accomplishments. Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its students. The emblematic animal was a badger, and yellow and black were its house colours.</div>

						<div class="gryffindor-accordion">

						<div class="slytherin-accordion">
							<button class="slytherin-accordion__toggle">Slytherin</button>

Slytherins tended to take charge and possessed strong leadership skills. They were often self-assured and confident of their own competence and can be very loyal.</div>
